    \begin{abstract}
        This short document explains my work to support
        AI exam, taught by Prof. Paolo Frasconi at University of Florence,
        comments some results and shows how to reproduce test cases.
        I implemented a Prolog program that produce a schedule for the
        problem at hand, satisfying the requested constraints.

    \section{Problem Analysis}
    In this exercise we tackle a scheduling problem on classes allocation
    for a generic university. It is a small instance of a real scenario
    and in the following sections we describe the considered constraints,
    Prolog predicates that fullfil them and how to describe a scheduling
    dataset by predicates ready for computation.
    We can formalize the problem as follow:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a set of rooms $R = \lbrace r_1, \ldots, r_n \rbrace$, each
            one of them is described with a name and the number
            of available sittings;
        \item a set of teachings $T = \lbrace t_1, \ldots, t_m \rbrace$, each
            one of them is described with a name and the hours taught in a week;
        \item a set of professors $P = \lbrace p_1, \ldots, p_s \rbrace$, each
            one of them is described with a name and a subset of $T$ of teachings
            it is capable to teach;
        \item a set of degree courses $C = \lbrace c_1, \ldots, c_q \rbrace$, each
            one of them is described with a name, a subset $T^\prime$ of teachings
            and a number of students interested in each offered teaching;
        \item a subset of courses $C^\prime$ could share a subset $T^\prime$ of teachings.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Implemented Constraints}
    Over the previous problem definition it is required to produce a
    schedule, ie a set of ``teaching slots'' over a standard set of
    working days $D = \lbrace Monday, Thusday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday \rbrace$,
    such that the following constraints hold:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item given a day $d \in D$, no time overlapping for each professor $p$,
            ie if $p$ teach two different teachings then their time slots
            have to be disjoint;
        \item given a day $d \in D$, no time overlapping for each room $r$,
            ie if in $r$ two different teachings happen to be taught then
            their time slots have to be disjoint;
        \item to each professor $p$ at most $2$ teachings can be assigned
            (while it is possible to design a dataset where $p$ is capable
            to teach more teachings);
        \item given a day $d \in D$, each professor $p$ cannot teach more than
           $4$ hours;
        \item given a day $d \in D$, if a teaching $t$ is taught in $d$ then
            $t$ have to be taught for at least $2$ and at most $4$ hours;
        \item if a teaching $t$, shared by a subset of courses
            $\lbrace (c_1, t, s_1), \ldots, (c_n, t, s_n)\rbrace$,
            is taught in a room $r = (name, s)$ then $s_1 + \ldots + s_n \leq s$,
            where $s$ is the number of available sittings in $r$ and
            $s_i$ is the number of students interested in teaching $t$ enrolled
            to course $c_i$.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Prolog Predicates}
    In order to produce a schedule such that all constraints are met, I
    implemented a Prolog program which consist of a main file \footnote{
       find it in \emph{clp-fd/scheduler.prolog}} and in this section I describe
    quickly the most important predicates and the used coding technique, while
    in the next section it is described how to describe a problem instance.

    A top level predicate \textbf{go/1} is introduced as an interface in order
    to solve the supplied scheduling problem, printing the running time and a
    solution which, for a simple instance, looks like as the following:
    \begin{verbatim}
[schedule(monday,time(8,10),auditorium,computer_science,bianchi,[engineering]),
schedule(tuesday,time(8,10),auditorium,computer_science,bianchi,[engineering]),
...
schedule(monday,time(12,14),auditorium,algebra,verdi,[engineering,medicine])]
    \end{verbatim}
    Let $ts$ be a ground term representing a ``teaching slot''. If $ts$ belongs to a
    solution, such that $ts = schedule(d, time(s,e), r, t, p, cs)$,
    then $ts$ has the following meaning:
    \begin{quote}
        on day $d$, professor $p$ teaches teaching $t$ in room $r$,
        starting at $s$ till $e$, and every student interested in following $t$
        which is enrolled to course $c \in cs$ can attend the class
    \end{quote}

    Variables about day, professor, teaching, room and timings
    are instantiated within \textbf{valid/6} predicate.
    Every time a variable is instantiated some
    checks are performed in order to fail as soon as possible if such
    instantiation is not a good one. This shows the ``accumulator''
    coding technique and it explains why predicate \textbf{valid/6} has
    such an high ariety, since collecting arguments needs to be passed around.
    An entry predicate \textbf{valid/1} is defined in order to build
    initial values for such collecting parameters.
    Observe that using this coding style, has been
    possible to code \textbf{valid/6} as a \emph{tail recursive} predicate.

    Some auxiliary predicates have been defined in order to take apart
    the complexity in small pieces, each one ensuring a requested constraint,
    to name a few of them: \textbf{ensure\_professor\_teaches\_at\_most\_two\_teachings/4},
    \textbf{ensure\_no\_overlapping\_for\_teaching\_in\_the\_same\_day/5} and so on.


    \subsection{Specifying datasets}
    An instance of a problem can be defined using the following predicates:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{room($n$, $s$)} means $n$ is the name
            of a room containing $s$ sittings;
        \item \textbf{teaching($t$, $h$)} means $t$ is the name
            of a teaching which is taught $h$ hours a week;
        \item \textbf{teaches($p$, $t$)} means $p$ is the name
            of a professor which can teach teaching $t$;
        \item \textbf{course($c$, $t$, $s$)} means $s$ students
            enrolled in course $c$ are interested in following
            teaching $t$, offered by that course.
    \end{itemize}
    In order to express that a teaching $t$ is shared by a subset of
    courses $\lbrace c_1, \ldots, c_n \rbrace$ write down $n$ clauses
    as follows:
    \begin{displaymath}
        \begin{split}
            & course(c_1, t, s_1).\\
            & \ldots \\
            & course(c_n, t, s_n).
        \end{split}
    \end{displaymath}
    Moreover, if two courses $c_1, c_2$ both have a teaching $t$ about
    a given topic but their programs do not allow to share, then
    a dedicated teaching has to be defined, as follow:
    \begin{displaymath}
        \begin{split}
            & course(c_1, t_1, s_1).\\
            & course(c_2, t_2, s_2).
        \end{split}
    \end{displaymath}
    assigning professors (not necessary different) to $t_1, t_2$.

    \section{Test cases}
